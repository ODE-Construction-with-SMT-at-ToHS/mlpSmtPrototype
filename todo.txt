-> use regression to generate find input parameters, use SMT to proof max derivation
-> scale: use input data that is more difficult to solve (more dimensions, trigonometric, a*x+b*u
-> use a different technique to generate input data: iteratively generate more data -- modell not executable!? -> Ábrahám
-> write paper
	* case-study
	* things to mention:
		* which input clusters activate certain neurons? -> mark neurons
