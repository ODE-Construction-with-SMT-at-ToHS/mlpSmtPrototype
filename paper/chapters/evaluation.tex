However, this does not guarantee improvement. Also including an outlier in the fitting process does not give any guarantees w.r.t. accuracy.}\\

    Due to the novelty of this approach (see Section~\ref{sec:rel}), it is impossible for us to compare it to existing ones. Due to the methodical differences of the presented approaches (see Table~\ref{tab:com}), comparing them quantitatively with each other is also not sensible. Therefore we can (1) qualitatively evaluate the approaches and (2) quantitatively evaluate the approaches through comparing the performance of the same approach on different MLPs.\par
    A methodical comparison can be found in Table~\ref{tab:com}.\par

    All tests were executed on the Intel Xeon Platinum 8160 Processors “SkyLake” (2.1 GHz) with 8 GB of memory. Each test with zero splits was given one CPU core and each test with one split was given two CPU cores and a timeout of 5 hours. Only the tests for the MLP with 57 nodes were given 16 GB of memory.\par
    Table~\ref{tab:smt_default} and~\ref{tab:smt_optimize} show runtimes of the methods described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:smt1} and~\ref{subsubsec:smt2}, respectively. The number of timeouts show that optimizing the parameters w.r.t. $\epsilon$ did not improve the runtime and lead to a notable number of timeouts. Splitting at certain nodes for parallelization did also not improve runtime.
    Table~\ref{tab:least_squares} shows the results of the method described in Section~\ref{subsec:sqa}. We can see that this approach worked quite well and was also able to give relatively small deviation intervals using only 4 interval-refinement steps. However, \lstinline{find_deviation} repeatedly lead to a timeout on a network with 57 nodes.\par
    We can generally observe that larger models lead to timeouts. Although repeatedly tried, we were not able to get results for any model with more than 20 nodes.
