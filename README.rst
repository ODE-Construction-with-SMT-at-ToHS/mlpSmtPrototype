General
#######
This project is a prototype for an algorithm to find a closed form for a multilayer perceptron. For a more detailed
description of the algorithm and its versions, read our `(not yet written) paper <link-to.paper>`_.

Features
########
*  create and train MLPs on a given function, depict error
*  find a closed form for the input-output relation of the MLP. *(Ideally, the learned function form the point above should be found.)*
